                <p>The selection of the interim outcomes should be based on the conclusions from the previous analysis: actor mapping, decision-making process, enabling factors and barriers (including the contextual information obtained from the prioritizing table). </p>
                <p>For example: a) an organization defines as its advocacy objective the adoption of a Law“X” next year; b) the actor mapping shows that there are active supporters and opponents with similar level of power; the public is neutral and there are few grassroots organizations with some influence working on the issue; c) The decision-making process analysis shows that the Law has been assigned to the Committee on Labour, which will be a key player during the adoption process. Then, in order to move the balance in your favour and progress in the achievement of your objectives your interim outcomes will probably include changes in the public such as increase their awareness on the issue so they position themselves in favour of it and to build their public will to act in support of the issue so they put pressure on decision-makers. You will most likely also aim for powerful messages delivered by the media or new champions to encourage the supporters and influence the public so they can become a force to move opponents to reduce their opposition to the policy change.</p>
                <p>Interim outcomes indicate movements towards the advocacy objective, they are “measures of effect” and therefore they “should also be worded in terms of the desired result or achievement, not in terms of the activity or what will be done”. “Raise support for children’s rights among key decision-makers,” for example, is activity-oriented. A results-oriented outcome is: “Decision-makers X, Y and Z will demonstrate their increased support for children’s rights by calling for increased funding for boys’ and girls’ primary education.” </p>
                <p>The interim outcomes can be organized in a logical chain where the combined effort of reaching some of them contributes to achieve the overall advocacy objective. The deeper you have worked in your analysis of problems, the more accurate you will be in organising your outcomes. This logical chain is sometimes known as your theory of change, which explains how you expect policy change to happen and what will pave the way to the implementation of the desired policy solution. </p>
