The analysis must be pulled together and guide the definition of the shorter term results (interim outcomes) that must be achieved in order to reach the advocacy objective and the actions that will contribute to the interim outcomes (UNICEF (2010) Advocacy toolkit). Developing an advocacy strategy entails figuring out how to reach interim outcomes while keeping the long-term vision alive. </p>

                                    <p>As pointed out in the UNICEF (2010) Advocacy toolkit (pg.58), interim outcomes indicate movements towards the advocacy objective, they are “measures of effect” and therefore they “should also be worded in terms of the desire result or achievement not in terms of the activity or what will be done”.  “Raise support for children’s rights among key decision-makers,” for example, is activity-oriented. A results-oriented outcome is: “Decision-makers X, Y and Z will demonstrate their increased support for children’s rights by calling for increased funding for boys’ and girls’ primary education.”</p>

          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>The interim outcomes can be organized in a logical chain where the combined effort of reaching some of them contributes to achieve the overall objective. The deeper you have worked in your analysis of problems the more accurate you will be in organising your outcomes. This logical chain is sometimes known as your theory of change, which explains how do you expect the change to happen and what will pave the way to the implementation of the policy solution that you have described above.</p>
          <p>You will describe how do you expect the change to happen and what will pave the way to the implementation of the policy solution that you have described above. Your theory of change explains the causal links between your actions and the intended impact.</p>
