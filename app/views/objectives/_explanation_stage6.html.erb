<h4>What do you want the target audience to do?</h4>
<p>After you have identified the target audiences/critical players (actors who bring about the change you aim for and those who can influence them) you should define the “asks” for each of them. These are the actions you want them to understake to support the achievement of your advocacy objective. They should be clear, concise, solution-focused, and tailored to each actor.</p>
<p>Communication specialists will craft powerful messages based on the information obtained in the previous steps, the “asks” that you will define at this stage, and other relevant information, such as the motivation of the audience or the communication channel. Having a broad range of solid messages ready to be used is necessary for your advocacy efforts. You can then communicate them in a number of formats (lobby meetings, letters, interviews in the media, etc).</p>
