      <h2>What problems you want to address? What policy change you aim to achieve?</h2>
      <p>The foundation of an effective advocacy strategy is a common understanding of the main problems that affect children, their policy dimensions and related policy solutions. It is important you take time to go through this discussion because without a clear, articulated issue and well-defined problems and solutions the remaining parts of the strategy will lose focus.</p>
