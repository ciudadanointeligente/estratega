      description: "The foundation of an effective advocacy strategy is a common understanding of the main problems that affect children, their policy dimensions and related policy solutions. It is important you take time to go through this discussion because without a clear, articulated issue and well-defined problems and solutions the remaining parts of the strategy will lose focus."

For instance, whenever is possible, it should include the geographical scope, a time period, and population affected (see example below)"

                          <p>What are the main policy solutions that would resolve the problems identified and that UNICEF would like to see adopted?</p>
                          <p>The policy solutions usually refer to:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Policy development (ex. Development of a nutrition national plan)</li>
                            <li>Placement on the policy agenda. (Ex: Official paper on new financing mechanisms)</li>
                            <li>Policy adoption. (Ex: approval of equal pay act)</li>
                            <li>Policy blocking: (Ex. Rejection of anti-homosexuality bill)</li>
                            <li>Policy implementation: (Ex. Implementation of regulations forbidding summary deportations by the police)</li>
                            <li>Policy maintenance. (Ex.: No reduction of budgets for child protection policies)</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>In those contexts where a policy change may be too ambitious, an organization may aim for a discursive change (which should pave the way for a policy change in the longer run). For instance, for many years, given the lack of options to achieve change on policies related to tax heavens, organizations working on tax justice focused their advocacy efforts on a change in the discourse in the society so tax havens were seen by the majority as an unacceptable practice that distract critical resources for the countries to pay for social services. These efforts built the ground for changes in policy later on when opportunities appeared (i.e. with the 2008 financial crisis).</p>

      title1: "Which real-world problem children are facing that you want to address?"
      title1_description: |
                          <p>A real-world problem is the negative situation children face that UNICEF would like to change (malnutrition, child poverty, infant mortality, disparities in education, etc). At the early stages of the planning process you should identify and articulate the real-world problem you want to address. The problem should be described as precisely and concretely as possible. For instance, whenever is possible, it should include the geographical scope, a time period, and population affected (see example below)</p>
      title2: "Which are the policy-related causes of the real-world problem?"
      title2_description: |
                          <p>Behind the real-world problems there are usually multiple causes, including causes related to programmes, to bad practices or to the policymaking environment. Advocacy work focuses specifically on the latest and often refers to causes such as deficient governance mechanisms, inadequate legal framework or imbalanced power relationships. Therefore, your problem analysis should prioritize the identification of these causes rather than all the factors behind the real-world problem.</p>
                          <p>To conduct the problem analysis, you can use a problem tree. The problem tree is a well-known tool that ‚Äúwill help advocates understand the immediate, underlying and root causes of the issue, as well as help in gathering information to support the analysis‚Äù.</p>
      title3: "Which policy solutions would constitute an appropriate response?"
      title3_description: |
                          <p>What are the main policy solutions that would resolve the problems identified and that UNICEF would like to see adopted?</p>
                          <p>The policy solutions usually refer to:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Policy development (ex. Development of a nutrition national plan)</li>
                            <li>Placement on the policy agenda. (Ex: Official paper on new financing mechanisms)</li>
                            <li>Policy adoption. (Ex: approval of equal pay act)</li>
                            <li>Policy blocking: (Ex. Rejection of anti-homosexuality bill)</li>
                            <li>Policy implementation: (Ex. Implementation of regulations forbidding summary deportations by the police)</li>
                            <li>Policy maintenance. (Ex.: No reduction of budgets for child protection policies)</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>In those contexts where a policy change may be too ambitious, an organization may aim for a discursive change (which should pave the way for a policy change in the longer run). For instance, for many years, given the lack of options to achieve change on policies related to tax heavens, organizations working on tax justice focused their advocacy efforts on a change in the discourse in the society so tax havens were seen by the majority as an unacceptable practice that distract critical resources for the countries to pay for social services. These efforts built the ground for changes in policy later on when opportunities appeared (i.e. with the 2008 financial crisis).</p>

      title: "Which external factors you need to take into account in your advocacy planning?"
      title_description: "Understanding the decision-making cycle, the political forces both for and against your objectives and the enabling factors and barriers that you will likely encounter during the implementation of your advocacy plan will allow you to assess the feasibility of your objectives and to be accurate and effective in your targeting and planning. All this information will then shape the definition of the interim outcomes (see below)."
      subtitle1: "Understand the institutional and decision-making cycles"
      subtitle1_explanation: "Policy decisions are often made according to a cycle or schedule. To maximise your influence you need to have a sound understanding of the policy processes. First, because the analysis of the decision-making process helps to identify opportunities and entry points to begin influencing on a given issue. Second, because last-minute interventions rarely work, and the earlier in the decision-making cycle the idea is accepted, the more effective the end result is likely to be"
      subtitle2: "Map the actors and analyse their influence and support"
      subtitle2_explanation: "Effective advocacy requires having a good understanding of all relevant actors: those with power to make change happen (decision-makers); those with influence over the decision-makers (influencers); and those in the community who would be supportive or opposing forces."
      subtitle3: "Identify additional enabling factors and barriers"
      subtitle3_tooltip: "Thanks to the prioritizing table, the decision-making cycle analysis and the actor mapping you will have already identified a number of enabling factors and barriers to achieve your chosen objective. However, you may need to go deeper into the analysis of the context surrounding the specific policy change that you want to pursue. You should think devote time to think about additional relevant enabling factors and barriers of different nature: financial, social, technological, factual, political, religious, cultural, geographical, organizational, etc."

                  <p>The selection of the interim outcomes should be based on the conclusions from the previous analysis: actor mapping, decision-making process, enabling factors and barriers (including the contextual information obtained from the prioritizing table).</p>
                  <p>For example: a) an organization defines as its advocacy objective the adoption of a Law‚ÄúX‚Äù next year; b) the actor mapping shows that there are active supporters and opponents with similar level of power; the public is neutral and there are few grassroots organizations with some influence working on the issue; c) The decision-making process analysis shows that the Law has been assigned to the Committee on Labour, which will be a key player during the adoption process. Then, in order to move the balance in your favour and progress in the achievement of your objectives your interim outcomes will probably include changes in the public such as increase their awareness on the issue so they position themselves in favour of it and to build their public will to act in support of the issue so they put pressure on decision-makers. You will most likely also aim for powerful messages delivered by the media or new champions to encourage the supporters and influence the public so they can become a force to move opponents to reduce their opposition to the policy change.</p>
                  <p>Interim outcomes indicate movements towards the advocacy objective, they are ‚Äúmeasures of effect‚Äù and therefore they ‚Äúshould also be worded in terms of the desired result or achievement, not in terms of the activity or what will be done‚Äù. ‚ÄúRaise support for children‚Äôs rights among key decision-makers,‚Äù for example, is activity-oriented. A results-oriented outcome is: ‚ÄúDecision-makers X, Y and Z will demonstrate their increased support for children‚Äôs rights by calling for increased funding for boys‚Äô and girls‚Äô primary education.‚Äù</p>
                  <p>The interim outcomes can be organized in a logical chain where the combined effort of reaching some of them contributes to achieve the overall advocacy objective. The deeper you have worked in your analysis of problems, the more accurate you will be in organising your outcomes. This logical chain is sometimes known as your theory of change, which explains how you expect policy change to happen and what will pave the way to the implementation of the desired policy solution.</p>

      subtitle1_explanation:  |
                    <p>After you have identified the target audiences/critical players (actors who bring about the change you aim for and those who can influence them) you should define the ‚Äúasks‚Äù for each of them. These are the actions you want them to understake to support the achievement of your advocacy objective. They should be clear, concise, solution-focused, and tailored to each actor.</p>
                    <p>Communication specialists will craft powerful messages based on the information obtained in the previous steps, the ‚Äúasks‚Äù that you will define at this stage, and other relevant information, such as the motivation of the audience or the communication channel. Having a broad range of solid messages ready to be used is necessary for your advocacy efforts. You can then communicate them in a number of formats (lobby meetings, letters, interviews in the media, etc).</p>

      title: "What problems you want to address? What policy change you aim to achieve?"
      description: "The foundation of an effective advocacy strategy is a common understanding of the main problems that affect children, their policy dimensions and related policy solutions. It is important you take time to go through this discussion because without a clear, articulated issue and well-defined problems and solutions the remaining parts of the strategy will lose focus."
      subtitle1: "Which real-world problem children are facing that you want to address?"
      subtitle1_tooltip: "A real-world problem is the negative situation children face that UNICEF would like to change (malnutrition, child poverty, infant mortality, disparities in education, etc). At the early stages of the planning process you should identify and articulate the real-world problem you want to address. The problem should be described as precisely and concretely as possible. For instance, whenever is possible, it should include the geographical scope, a time period, and population affected (see example below)"

Advocacy work focuses specifically on the latest and often refers to causes such as deficient governance mechanisms, inadequate legal framework or imbalanced power relationships. Therefore, your problem analysis should prioritize the identification of these causes rather than all the factors behind the real-world problem"
